## Features

### Door Control System  
- **Password-Protected Door Lock**: Uses a servo motor to secure or unlock the door.  
- **Temperature Monitoring**: Displays real-time temperature on an LCD screen.  
- **Motion Detection**: Detects movement for additional security.  
- **WiFi Control**: Operated remotely using the RemoteXY app.  

### LPG & Flame Detection System  
- **LPG Leak Detection**: Triggers an alarm for high gas concentration.  
- **Flame Detection**: Activates a water pump and buzzer when a flame is detected.
